# push_swap
The objective of this project is to sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. Read **push_swap.pdf** file to understand the task. Use **make** command to compile source files.  
  
This project is developed for **Linux**. There is also **checker_linux** file in repository. It is a binary file that checks the correctness of sorting and displays **OK** if all is good. The checker can be run by command like 
```bash
ARG="4 67 3 87 23"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker_OS $ARG
```
